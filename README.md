## Installation

Clone or download the folders to your local machine and run the index.html file in a browser of your choice.


## Instructions

The app will automatically load a news feed and by clicking the menu icon you can change to a particular news feed of your choice. 

##  Testing

When the index.html file is run by a browser the test results will be shown at the bottom of the browser window. By inspecting the code and changing variable names the tests will fail.
